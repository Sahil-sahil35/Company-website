      "detailedDescription": "Activated Carbon has been used as an adsorbent for centuries early uses of carbon were reported for water filtration and for sugar solution purification. Activated carbons ability to remove a large variety of compounds from contaminated waters has led to its increased use in the last thirty years. Recent changes in water discharge standards regarding toxic pollutants has placed additional emphasis on this technology. Granulated carbons are used for water treatment, deodorization and separation of components of flow system. We are offering a range of Granular Activated Carbon for Water Purification to our client depending upon mesh size, iodine content, etc.",
